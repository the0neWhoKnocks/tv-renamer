However, Kirito and Klein cannot log out of the game for some reason. As most of the players head to the village square, a red-hooded figure suddenly appears in the sky. The figure reveals himself to be Akihiko Kayaba, the game's creator and tells them they cannot log-out was made on purpose. Furthermore, he reveals they cannot log-out by simply removing the NerveGear, the VR helmet they use to log-in the game as it will kill them instantly. The only way to log out is for the players to beat and clear all 100 floors of the game and should they die in the game, their real bodies will die as well. As a parting gift, Akihiko gives them a mirror which reveals their real looks on their avatars. As everyone goes into shock of their new predicament, Kirito ask Klein to follow him to the next village to level up as soon as possible but Klein politely declines as he wishes to remain with his friends but promises to see him again. Kirito heads out, vowing to be free from this game. By the end of the first month, 2,000 players have died and the 1st floor has yet to be cleared.",

After a flashback of Kazuto's talk with Asuna the previous day, Suguha tells him that she is worried due to Kazuto having a frightening expression when he returned home last night. Kazuto then calmed Suguha down by promising that he would be back. Meanwhile, Shino vents her anger about Kirito to Kyōji, who then tells her that she isn't acting like her normal self and, after a short conversation, tries to hug her, but is rejected by her. At the hospital, after seeing that Kazuto was troubled by something, Aki offers a free counselling session. When Kazuto tells her about how he killed the Laughing Coffin members in SAO, she tells him that she cannot help him with that burden, but reminds him that he killed them in order to protect others. After calming down, Kazuto logs into GGO. Meanwhile, in Alfheim Online, after completing a boss fight, Asuna and the others get ready to watch the broadcast of the BoB tournament. In GGO, Sinon meets Kirito at the General Governor's Office, and they tell each other that they will not lose.",

After she explains the rules and regulations, Kirito stops Sinon from leaving and asks her whether there were BoB participants that she did not know about.

After Pale Rider defeats Dyne, he is suddenly shot with a silenced stun bullet and, after several moments, the shooter, Death Gun, reveals himself from the bridge.

Then, while thinking about how Death Gun was able to stop the heart of players by shooting them in the game, Kirito realizes that Death Gun did not shoot him with the pistol, but with the sniper instead. Based on this, Kirito deduces that Death Gun had to make preparations in real life to be able to kill the players with his pistol, and that he could've seen players putting their real-life details in the General Governor's Office since it was an open space and the terminals did not offer much privacy. Kirito then brings up the idea that Death Gun could have used his mantle to spy on other players without being noticed. After some thinking, Kirito realizes that Death Gun was actually two people: one shoots the player in-game, the other kills the player in real life by injecting them with a lethal drug.

Kirito deduces that Death Gun is really the infamous, \"Red Eyed,\" Xaxa, the second in command of Laughing Coffin.
